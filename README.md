# fabric-sdk-kvs-secretsmanager

A pluggable key value store for storing and retrieving secrets generated by fabric-sdk-node onto AWS Secrets Manager. This can be installed via NPM.

## Install

```bash
npm i fabric-sdk-kvs-secretsmanager
```

## Config

1. config your network definition to use AWS credentialStore

```yaml
# your network.yaml
client:
  # Since the node.js SDK supports pluggable KV stores, the properties under "credentialStore"
  # are implementation specific
  credentialStore:
    url: 'https://secretsmanager.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'
    region: 'us-east-1'
    profile: 'test'

    # Specific to the CryptoSuite implementation. Software-based implementations like
    # CryptoSuite_ECDSA_AES.js requires a key store. PKCS#11 based implementations does
    # not.
    cryptoStore:
      # Specific to the underlying KeyValueStore that backs the crypto key store.
      url: 'https://secretsmanager.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'
      region: 'us-east-1'
      profile: 'test'
```

2. config fabric-sdk-node to use fabric-ca-kvs-secretsmanager 

```javascript
const Client = require('fabric-client');

//fabric-sdk-kvs-secretsmanager
Client.setConfigSetting('key-value-store', 'fabric-sdk-kvs-secretsmanager');

// load the network.yaml from  previous step
const client = Client.loadFromConfig('<path-to-your-network.yaml>');

// initialize credential stores
await client.initCredentialStores();

// then it's done.

// Now you just need to get from state store
const user = await client.loadUserFromStateStore(username);
await client.setUserContext(user);

// run invoke/query with this identity

```

## Check the credentials from AWS
use AWS Console to see what is in the secretsmanager store.
